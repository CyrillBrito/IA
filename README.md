# IA

IA - Inteligência artificial (Portuguese)

AI - Artificial intelligence

This class covers the essential information about artificial intelligence, starting from search trees and ending with neural networks. The professors of the class were António Ruano and Fernando Lobo. Some of the concepts learned in the class:

* Basic concepts
* Blind search
* A*
* Heuristic functions
* Minimax
* Genetic algorithms
* Neural networks

During the semester we had 3 problems to solve, these problems where solved using java. You can see the all of the solved problems in my [GitHub](https://github.com/CyrillBrito/IA). Folder structure:

* /(problem_name)
   * /doc - The problem given by the professor and my report
   * /src - The .java files created to solve the problem

List of all the problems that me and my colleges had to solve in the class (the problems and reports are written in Portuguese):

* Troika Cube - Solve a easier version of Rubiks cube using A*.
	* [Problem](https://github.com/CyrillBrito/IA/blob/master/Troika%20Cube/doc/problem.pdf).
	* [Solution](https://github.com/CyrillBrito/IA/tree/master/Troika%20Cube/src).
	* [Report](https://github.com/CyrillBrito/IA/blob/master/Troika%20Cube/doc/report.pdf).

* Magic Square - Solve the biggest possible magic square using Genetic algortihms.
	* [Problem](https://github.com/CyrillBrito/IA/blob/master/Magic%20Square/doc/problem.pdf).
	* [Solution](https://github.com/CyrillBrito/IA/tree/master/Magic%20Square/src).
	* [Report](https://github.com/CyrillBrito/IA/blob/master/Magic%20Square/doc/report.pdf).

* Drop 4 - This problem was a free theme, I choose to use Q-learning to play a game.
	* [Problem](https://github.com/CyrillBrito/IA/blob/master/Drop%204/doc/problem.pdf).
	* [Solution](https://github.com/CyrillBrito/IA/tree/master/Drop%204/src).
	* [Report](https://github.com/CyrillBrito/IA/blob/master/Drop%204/doc/report.pdf).
