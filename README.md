* Sub-strings
* ...

You can see the all of the solved problems made on the class in my [GitHub](https://github.com/CyrillBrito/IA). Folder structure:

* /(problem_name)
   * /doc - The problem given by the professor and my report
   * /src - The .java files created to solve the problem

List of all the problems that me and my colleges had to solve in the class (the problems are written in Portuguese):
